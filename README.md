# Taskmaster Frontend

## Overview

This is the ultra simple react frontend for the Taskmaster application. Taskmaster is an api that consists of tasks such as the title of what it is, what date it was created and assigned, and it shows the progress of the task.

## Features

This react application consists of two fragments. One fragment is the nav and the other fragment is Tasks. The Task fragment is where most of the work is happening.  Inside Task is the api call to the backend and there is functionality to display those tasks.
